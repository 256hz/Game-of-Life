# Game-of-Life
Game of Life REPL in Python.  Infinite board, ASCII representation.  This is a "semi-functional" implementation, with the grid as the most object-like element.

The Game defaults to an Eater pattern on open.  With each turn, you have the following options:

- Hit Enter for the next turn
- List the other patterns you can try
- Change to a different pattern
- Quit

Happy Gaming!
